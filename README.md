## Design

### Design Choices
The webpage was designed to give parents an aesthetics feel of the online school. Parents would then be re-assured with our clear explanation of our methodology and stem-rich selection of subjects. 

### Colour
For the colour theme, bright and dark blue tones are used. When learning tough material, blue is a colour that stands for productivity. The ability of the colour blue to provide a secure, inviting learning atmosphere where students may grasp difficult and interesting material is well acknowledged.

### Fonts
Lato has several various styles and is quite legible, making it a suitable typeface for websites. Both fonts are considered dyslexia friendly.
<br>

Oswald is a sans serif font that pairs well with almost any other serif or sans serif typeface. It is that alluring and accommodating. It always adds contrast to a typographic combination because to its minor elongation. 

### Structure

The webpages have a familiar, identifiable, user-friendly, and simple to understand structure. When a visitor first visits a website, they are greeted by a recognizable navigation bar with the page's primary header located in the centre of each page.

There are five distinct pages on the website:

- A topic page that highlights in detail all the needs and expectations of each subject 
- An image gallery that highlights the aesthetics feel of the online school
- A homepage that breaks down our technique for online teaching into three sections.
- A registration page with a map of the area and contact information
