## Design

### Design Choices
The webpage was designed to give parents an aesthetics feel of the online school. Parents would then be re-assured with our clear explanation of our methodology and stem-rich selection of subjects. 

### Colour
For the colour theme, bright and dark blue tones are used. When learning tough material, blue is a colour that stands for productivity. The ability of the colour blue to provide a secure, inviting learning atmosphere where students may grasp difficult and interesting material is well acknowledged.
