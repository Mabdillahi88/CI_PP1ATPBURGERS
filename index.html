            <h2>Tailored to you</h2>
            <p>Depending on the subject and age of student, subjects may include a “lead” 
              lesson (seminar) and a “follow” lesson (tutorial of up to 20 students). 
              Students apply the knowledge they have learned through “apply” or homework assignments 
              and are assessed regularly through summative and formative assessments. Teachers use 
              online break out rooms, chats, polls, quizzes as well as virtual simulations to 
              encourage student interaction and foster engagement and understanding with the topic 
              being discussed.</p>
