            <h2>Tailored to you</h2>
            <p>Depending on the subject and age of student, subjects may include a “lead” 
              lesson (seminar) and a “follow” lesson (tutorial of up to 20 students). 
              Students apply the knowledge they have learned through “apply” or homework assignments 
              and are assessed regularly through summative and formative assessments. Teachers use 
              online break out rooms, chats, polls, quizzes as well as virtual simulations to 
              encourage student interaction and foster engagement and understanding with the topic 
              being discussed.</p>

              traditional teaching methods and curriculums, and creating a more 
              dynamic, relevant and powerful model reflecting current attitudes. We 
              nurture the unique individuality, talent and self-assurance of each student, 
              equipping them to take on the world with the skills and confidence to ensure success.</p>
